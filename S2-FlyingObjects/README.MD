# Assignment-1: Deploying a model on AWS Lambda

## Description

 "Flying Objects" is a generated dataset consisting of the images of the following classes:

 1. Large QuadCopters
 2. Small QuadCopters
 3. Winged Drones
 4. Flying Birds
 
The dataset was generated by the EVA4P2 study group. Below is a sample of the dataset:

## File-wise Details

- [handler.py](https://github.com/rajy4683/EVA4P2/blob/master/S1-BasicDeployment/handler.py): Contains the definition of the lambda function(classify_image) that will invoked on the AWS LAMBDA
- [serverless.yml](https://github.com/rajy4683/EVA4P2/blob/master/S1-BasicDeployment/serverless.yml): Deployment file used by the "serverless" framework to create the end-to-end deployment.
- [package.json](https://github.com/rajy4683/EVA4P2/blob/master/S1-BasicDeployment/package.json): contains the dependency file used during 'npm run deploy' phase.
- [requirements.txt](https://github.com/rajy4683/EVA4P2/blob/master/S1-BasicDeployment/requirements.txt): contains all the external packages that need to be deployed for 'handler.py'
- [imagenet_labels.py](https://github.com/rajy4683/EVA4P2/blob/master/S1-BasicDeployment/imagenet_labels.py): contains an Unordered dict of Imagenet class to name mappings
